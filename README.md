# espectrally_for_you
This is some code that was used to create an Astronomy on Tap game at the 2024 SDSS collaboration meeting. The idea of this is to get people thinking about spectra by making approximate spectra of images and then asking the audience to guess which image this comes from. 


# Licences
I've included the code here, it's under an MIT license. I've put a few example images in the images folder. These are under difference licenses, see the license document in the image folder
